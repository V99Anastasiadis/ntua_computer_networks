ðŸ“¡ Internet Protocols Labs - Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to a series of hands-on laboratory exercises completed as part of the Computer Networks course at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) during the academic year 2023â€“2024.

Throughout these labs, I explored and analyzed the fundamental technologies and protocols that power the Internet, such as IP, ARP, ICMP, TCP, UDP, DNS, FTP, HTTP, SMTP, DHCP, and others. Special emphasis was placed on capturing and analyzing real network traffic to understand the operational details of these protocols within IP networks.
Labs Covered

    Lab 1: Introduction to Wireshark and Internet Addressing

    Lab 2: Encapsulation and Protocol Headers (OSI and TCP/IP models)

    Lab 3: Local Area Network Communication (Ethernet and ARP)

    Lab 4: IPv4 Protocol and Packet Fragmentation

    Lab 5: Internet Route Discovery and IPv4 TTL Field

    Lab 6: ICMP Protocol and Network Diagnostics

    Lab 7: Transport Layer Protocols (UDP and TCP)

    Lab 8: Application Layer Protocols (Telnet, FTP, TFTP)

    Lab 9: Email and Network Services (SMTP, DHCP)

    Lab 10: Domain Name System (DNS) and Name Resolution

    Lab 11: HTTP Protocol and Web Navigation

    Lab 12: Internet Security (Authentication, HTTPS, SSH, TLS)

Each lab includes packet captures, traffic analysis, and answers to theory and practical questions, offering a detailed insight into Internet architecture and protocol behavior.
